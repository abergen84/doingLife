#Doing Life

##Overview

Gotta set those reminders. This is an app that allows you to input reminders/tasks and allow you to check/uncheck them (if they are done/not done). As an added bonus, you're able filter between the different pages to see where each one falls under. Now get to checking your list off. Fun project to work with passing states/props between components

##Features

- Input box to add in a reminder
- Three tabs to check between All tasks, Done tasks, or Still Gotta Do tasks
- Checkbox next to each task that toggles whether it's done or not

##The Nitty Gritty

- React to handle the user view
- Backbone to handle Model, Collection, and triggers
